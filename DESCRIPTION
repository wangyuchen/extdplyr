Description: If 'dplyr' is a grammar for data manipulation, 'extdplyr' is like
    a short paragraph written in 'dplyr'. 'extdplyr' extends 'dplyr' and
    'tidyr' verbs to some common "routines" that manipulate data sets. It uses
    the same interface and preserves all the features from 'dplyr', has good 
    performance, and supports various data sources.
